For the purpose of this demonstration, we will first go to the admin option to have full control of the application.

After clicking the submit button, you should be directed to the list employee page again. You should be able to see the employee that you just added at the very bottom of the table.

Now, we can check for correctness with the database: on Oracle SQL Developer tool windows, click on the refresh button or press Ctrl+R to get the updated table.

The manager view is very similar to the admin view, the only difference is that the manager is not able to manage products. Therefore, the features related to the products will not be displayed in the manager view.

The next view will be the customer view. Customers will be able to list the products and search for products. However, the actions column is removed for customer view since they should not be able to edit the database.
